                    <h3>Favorite Book</h3>
                    <p>I am an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy novels, particularly drawn to the intricate world-building and character development in works by authors like Pierce Brown and John Flanagan. Despite my allure for their works of fiction, my allegience remains to the holy word of God, the Bible.</p>

                    <h3>Ideal Home</h3>
                    <p>My dream home would be in a rural local with a cozy mid-20th century house with a garden for my wife to tend to, a shed for me to workout in, and a large yard for my kids to play in.</p>

                    <h3>Secret Skill</h3>
                    <p>Strange as it may seem, I can read sheet music and play the flute. I had a 5 year trek into middle school and high school band, and I never strayed from my beloved woodwind. Every blue moon I pick it up just play to my heart's content.</p>
