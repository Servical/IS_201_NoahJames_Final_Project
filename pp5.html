                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Me and my darling dearest Claire are infatuated with each other and want to spend the rest of our lives together. But there's a significant obstacle that we have to face in our young relationship. She's out-of state and I still have a lot of schooling before I get my degree. This trial, difficult as it may seem, will be overcome by our fierce love for each other.</p>

                <h3>How We Met</h3>
                <p>God brought Claire and I together June 2025 at a church event in Illinois. I had just finished tearing my ACL, MCL, and Meniscus earlier that day. But then I found a sweetheart who would talk with me all night long and my sorrows were ended.</p>

                <h3>What I Love About Her</h3>
                <p>Claire and I have the same sense of humor and a deep love for each other. She's so beautiful and caring. She allows me to talk to her and trusts me enough to talk to me. But what I really love about us is that we can communicate and work through disagreements.</p>

            <div class="love-col">
                <h3>Little Traditions</h3>
                <p>We have many sayings that we love to repeat in our relationship. Every time one of us says "I'm glad", the other responds automatically with "I'm glad that your glad". There are many many more such catchphrases, but I would be remiss to exclude our nightly FaceTime calls as a key tradition of ours. </p>
